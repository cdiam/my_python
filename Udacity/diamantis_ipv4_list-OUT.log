remarks:        ***************************************************************
remarks:        Akamai serves the images and streaming content for many of the
remarks:        most popular Internet web-sites. When you connect to a web-site
remarks:        your browser first contacts the content provider and downloads
remarks:        an html file. This file contains embedded URLs that tell your
remarks:        browser where to find all the objects necessary to finish
remarks:        displaying the page. In the case of an "Akamaized" site, these
remarks:        URLs point to the Akamai Network. Next, your browser makes
remarks:        connections to the URLs to obtain the images or streaming
remarks:        content. Again, for an "Akamaized" site, your browser will
remarks:        contact an Akamai server to obtain the requested items.
remarks:        Generally a TCP server listens on a well-known port < 1023 (for
remarks:        example port 80 for HTTP), and a TCP client connects from a
remarks:        port > 1023 assigned by the operating system. So a connection
remarks:        from port 80 of the Akamai server to a high numbered port on
remarks:        your machine, is a normal HTTP transaction.
remarks:        If you'd like to learn more visit the FAQ at
